title: Jack Ferrante – a designer  and strategist in San Francisco.
---
I design products, experiences, and brand strategies that are thoughtful and straightforwards.

Most recently the Lead Creative Strategist at Very Great, I helped Wild One design their first [pop-up&nbsp;store](https://wonderful-rosalind-0681a8.netlify.com/projects/wild-one-toys.md), and their first line of [dog&nbsp;toys](/projects/wild-one-toys.md). I designed a portable [wireless](/projects/courant-carry.md)[&nbsp;](/projects/wild-one-toys.md)[charger](/projects/courant-carry.md) for Courant, and I drove the brand strategy for [Porter](/projects/w-p-porter.md), a line of make-and-take containers by W&P.

While in New York, I also focused on experiential design – working on freelance projects for [Chobani](/projects/chobani.md) and [Nike](/projects/nike.md).

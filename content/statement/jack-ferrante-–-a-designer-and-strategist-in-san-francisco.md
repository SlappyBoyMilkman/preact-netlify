title: Jack Ferrante – a designer  and strategist in San Francisco.

I create purposeful and strategic designs that are straightforward and effective.



Most recently the Lead Creative Strategist at Very Great, I helped Wild One design their first [pop-up store](/projects/pop-up.md), and their first line of [dog toys](/projects/dog-toys.md). I designed a portable [wireless charger](projects/wireless-charger.md) for Courant, and I drove the brand strategy for [Porter](/projects/porter.md), a line of make-and-take containers by W&P.



While in New York, I focused on experiential design – doing freelance projects for [Chobani](/projects/chobani.md) and [Nike](/projects/nike.md).

title: Jack Ferrante – a designer  and strategist in San Francisco.

I design products, experiences, and brand strategies that are thoughtful and straightforward.

Most recently the Lead Creative Strategist at Very Great, I helped Wild One design their first [pop-up&nbsp;store](/projects/wild-one-pop-up.md), and their first line of [dog&nbsp;toys](/projects/wild-one-toys.md). I designed a portable [wireless&nbsp;charger](/projects/courant-carry.md) for Courant, and I drove the brand strategy for [Porte](/project/w-p-porter.md)r, a line of make-and-take containersby W&P.

While in New York, I also focused on experiential design – working on freelance projects for [Chobani](/projects/chobani.md) and [Nike](/projects/nike.md).

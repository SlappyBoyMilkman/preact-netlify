shortDescription: Line of dog toys

  Wild One knew they wanted a chew, tug, and toss toy lineup for their first
  assortment of toys. Alongside the lead industrial designer, I built a product
  strategy that highlights Wild One's clean, minimalistic aesthetic and applied
  it to each of the product categories. We started with simple shapes and lines,
  and came out with the Bolt Bite, the Twist Toss, and the Shape Tug --- simple
  objects with intuitive function that are downright fun to play with.

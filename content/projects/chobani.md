description: >-
  Assisted in the translation and application of Chobani's brand refresh to
  physical spaces for events and experiential marketing. Under the direction of
  Ben Willett, I created environmental designs for Chobani's brand launch event
  to unveil the new branding. Bright colors and stark lighting elements evoke
  the fantastical feeling of a reimagined food Eden, a core concept of the
  rebrand.

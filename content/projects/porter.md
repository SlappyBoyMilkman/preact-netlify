description: >-
  W&P released it's initial line of make-and-take containers with the Porter
  bowl in ceramic or plastic. The Porter line provides a solution to curb the
  use of single use plastics in your daily life. I helped W&P find market
  opportunities in the container space, and provided brand strategy with line
  extension recommendations, materials research, art direction, and form
  development.

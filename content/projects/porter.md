  Shortly after their brand launch in August 2018, Wild One opened a 4 month
  pop-up location at 242 Lafayette in Nolita. The floorplan incorporated areas
  for merchandising and dwell space for pets and their humans. The banquette
  included workspaces that allowed the founders to introduce the brand story,
  and engage directly with their customers.

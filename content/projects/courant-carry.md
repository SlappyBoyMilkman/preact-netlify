shortDescription: Wireless charging power bank
description: >-
  Courant's core line of pebble grain, leather-wrapped, wireless chargers needed
  a portable companion. The CARRY enables users to charge wirelessly throughout
  the day. I applied Courant's fashion-meets-tech brand language to design a
  well-appointed device that's delightful to carry along with your phone.
